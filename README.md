# AAurus' Toyhou.se Codes

Here's where I'll be storing and working on the code for most of my Toyhou.se profile themes! It's a little sparse right now, since I want to get the minima family of themes set up and ready (as well as other life happenings), but I'm definitely hoping on filling out my collection when I have time.

#### Check out my [Toyhou.se template terms of use](https://toyhou.se/~bulletins/1692278.terms-of-use) here!  
(Toyhou.se members only; sorry to all non-members, as the platform is in closed beta at the moment)

# How to view without Toyhou.se
While these themes and templates were developed to be placed into Toyhou.se profiles and thus do not represent a fully functioning page on their own, you can use **[CircleJourney's Live Code Editor](https://th.circlejourney.net/#)** in order to preview the themes! Simply copy the code from the .html files, paste them into the editor, and click Update Preview to see the results.  
As of right now, all templates should be developed with non-premium users in mind, so it only requires the one block of text.

# Themes
- ### [minima](https://github.com/AAurus/toyhouse-codes/tree/main/minima)
  A simple theme with a LOT of content. Feel free to remove and replace elements as necessary. A standalone editor is in the works, with the ability to generate Toyhou.se compatible code as a possible feature.
